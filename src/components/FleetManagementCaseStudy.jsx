// ------------------------- FAQs -------------------------
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How did you mirror the mechanic workflow?",
    answer:
      "I conducted contextual interviews and live shadowing to ensure the PWA matched the physical whiteboard steps, capturing every decision point."
  },
  {
    question: "What tech stack powers FleetVision?",
    answer:
      "React + TailwindCSS for the PWA, Node.js microservices for APIs, Supabase (PostgreSQL) for data & auth, plus GitHub Actions & Netlify for CI/CD."
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly did mechanics adopt it?",
    answer:
      "Achieved 100% adoption across all mechanics within one week‚Äîthanks to the familiar checklist UI and zero-disruption rollout strategy."
  },
  {
    question: "How did you structure sprints and demos?",
    answer:
      "Ran two-week Scrum sprints, delivering two high-priority features per cycle. At sprint end I demoed live to the COO, gathered feedback, and triaged the next items immediately."
  },
  {
    question: "How did you onboard future developers & ensure maintainability?",
    answer:
 "I wrapped up the project with a clear, up-to-date README and concise architecture overview, named files and folders intuitively, and wrote clean, well-commented code‚Äîso that anyone can pick up the repo, understand its structure at a glance, and extend it without a steep learning curve."  },
  {
    question: "How did you implement secure authentication?",
    answer:
      "Leveraged Supabase‚Äôs JWT-based auth with row-level security policies. I defined roles for mechanics, managers and admins to restrict data access precisely."
  },
  {
    question: "How did you build the export tools?",
    answer:
      "Integrated jsPDF with auto-table plugins for client-side PDF exports and used SheetJS + File-Saver to generate / download Excel reports on demand."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the Part-Order Chatbot work under the hood?",
    answer: `
      Our Next.js API route creates a Supabase client using service-role credentials, then parses the user‚Äôs free-form question with three helpers:
      1. **parseDate** turns ‚ÄúDD/MM/YYYY‚Äù, ‚ÄúMM/YYYY‚Äù or ‚ÄúYYYY‚Äù strings into JavaScript Date objects.  
      2. **detectIntent** matches keywords (e.g. ‚Äúcount‚Äù, ‚Äúaverage‚Äù, ‚Äúsupplier‚Äù) to classify what the user wants (list, count, total, etc.).  
      3. **cleanQuery** strips filler words and punctuation, leaving only the core search term (like a PO number or supplier name).
      
      Based on the detected intent and any date, price or vehicle filters, the handler builds a Supabase query against our \`fleet_metrics_view\`, fetches the matching records, then formats a human-readable JSON answer (e.g. ‚ÄúOn 30/06/2025, we ordered ‚ÄòBrake Pads‚Äô (PO #123) for ‚Ç¨250 ex VAT‚Ä¶‚Äù).
    `.trim()
  },
  {
    question: "How are Service Notifications generated?",
    answer: `
      We run a server-side helper that:
      1. Queries \`service_info\` (with related \`job_cards‚Üívehicles\`) for all upcoming CVRT, tax, inspection, chassis and donkey service dates.
      2. For each record it calculates the days until due, then keeps only those within the next 7 days (or all future ones on initial run).
      3. Deduplicates by job card & service type‚Äîalways keeping the soonest date per job.
      4. Inserts these reminders into our \`notifications\` table, where they‚Äôll drive in-app alerts or calendar reminders.
    `.trim()
  },
  {
    question: "How did you optimise performance at scale?",
    answer:
      "Implemented code-splitting in Vite, applied GZIP compression, indexed key DB fields, and cached frequent queries‚Äîyielding sub-200ms dashboard loads."
